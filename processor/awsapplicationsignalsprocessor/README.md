# AWS AppSignals Processor

The AWS AppSignals processor is used to reduce the cardinality of telemetry metrics and traces before exporting them to CloudWatch Logs via [EMF](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awsemfexporter) and [X-Ray](github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/exporter/awsxrayexporter) respectively.
It reduces the cardinality of metrics/traces via 3 types of actions, `keep`, `drop` and `replace`, which are configured by users. Users ca configure these rules through configurations.

Note: Traces support only `replace` actions and are implicitly pulled from the logs section of the configuration
